Hello, and welcome to the Deterministic Blog! I am Mehmet Kutay Bozkurt, in my junior year of high school. 
I fricking love to code and love to do what I want to do. And this blog is what I want to do in my free time. 
This blog is going to be a general blog where I post anything related to coding, software development, 
mathematics, physics, and overall things that I love. I want this blog to be a place where I put my 
thoughts and ideas, and I want you, the viewer, to learn from and read what I write.

I also love the Nord Theme (duh!) and anything related to it. (Now I love Catppuccin, not Nord Theme.)

If you have anything to say to me, you can contact me through Discord and Twitter, which you can find 
the information on my [website](https://www.mkutay.dev).

Update on 4th of Jun, 2024: Since then, I have migrated my site to Vercel and Next.js and have changed the
name of the blog to "Kutay's Blog" to reflect that this is my personal blog. Previously, I wanted to invite my
friends to write on the blog but that didn't quite work out, though I still would love another author to write
something on here.
