In my latest post on why mathematics, as a research area, is lonely, I talked about why people just hate 
mathematics shortly but wanted to write another post, and here I am. In there, I mentioned how our society
is kind of divided into two: the ones that are good at mathematics and the ones that are not good at mathematics. I 
also alluded to how our teaching of mathematics in schools are terrible. In this post, I'm going to 
expand on what I talked in the other post, giving additional insights.

## Teaching, teaching, teaching

In [his essay](http://web.archive.org/web/20240603135346/https://maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf), 
Paul Lockhart strongly argues that the mathematics education in the US is terrible and that it doesn't allow 
students to learn the *art* of it. He likens the current mathematics education in schools to music education in a 
made up world, where music education (that wasn't created without any advice from a single working musician or a composer) 
is mandatory from primary school to high school. In that world, the "language of music,"
which are the black dots and lines in a sheet music, is taught until college. And, the more complex things, such as 
playing and listening to music, are put off till college or graduate school.

> Music class is where we
take out our staff paper, our teacher puts some notes on the board, and we copy them or
transpose them into a different key. We have to make sure to get the clefs and key signatures
right, and our teacher is very picky about making sure we fill in our quarter-notes completely.
One time we had a chromatic scale problem and I did it right, but the teacher gave me no credit
because I had the stems pointing the wrong way. (A Mathematician's Lament, page 1)

In this world, it is shameful if one third-grader didn't completely memorised their circle of fifths.
*I’ll have to get my son a music tutor. He simply
won’t apply himself to his music homework. He says it’s boring. He just sits there staring out
the window, humming tunes to himself and making up silly songs.*
In high school, there is more pressure on students, since they have to prepare for the standardized 
tests and the college admissions. Even if many students doesn't pursue mathematics later in 
university, it is nevertheless important that every member of this society be able to recognise a 
modulation or a fugal passage.

> It’s a lot for them to learn, but later in college
when they finally get to hear all this stuff, they’ll really appreciate all the work they did in high
school. (A Mathematician's Lament, page 1)

One might think that this imagined world, where such a beautiful and meaningful art is 
reduced to something so mindless, would never exist and no society would do such a thing to 
their children, to their future. This might not be the case for music, but it is the case for mathematics.
If you replace every music term above with the appropriate mathematics term, you get the current
mathematics education around most of the world today.
In his essay, Lockhart describes the current mathematics education as *if I had to design a mechanism for the 
express purpose of **destroying** a child’s natural curiosity and love of pattern-making, I couldn’t possibly 
do as good a job as is currently being done—I simply wouldn’t have the imagination to come up with the 
kind of senseless, soul—crushing ideas that constitute contemporary mathematics education*.

In my latest post, I mentioned the culture of mathematics—how the society sees mathematics. Or, how society
doesn't understand what mathematics is. Most think that it is somehow connected to science (maybe mathematics is 
the language of science). Nearly everyone would say mathematicians are "rational thinkers" rather than "poetic dreamers."
However, mathematics is the *purest* of all arts. Alright, you might say, why is mathematics the purest. 
Mathematicians enjoy thinking about *simple* things, and the simplest possible things are imaginary and pure.
They don't care about how a square isn't actually a "square" (since everything is made out of atoms).
A square in mathematician's mind is not a physical thing; it is a thing that what the mathematician is thinking;
it can be anything, as imaginary as possible.

In mathematics classes, students learn that the area of a triangle is equal to
$$
\text{area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height},
$$
and they are forced to memorise this "formula," without any of the reasoning behind it, or how we even came to this
relation. In reality, it comes from a mathematician wondering—just for the sake of it—what will the area of a 
triangle be when it's inside a rectangle.

<Image alt="Triangle Inside a Rectangle" src="/images/why-do-people-just-hate-mathematics/triangle-rectangle.png" width={400} height={0}/>

The rectangle and the triangle here are perfect and imaginary and pure. With the help of the orange crossed line,
we see that each part of the triangle that the orange line divides is half of the area of the rectangle that the line 
divides, and in total, the area of the triangle is equal to half of the area of the rectangle. Furthermore, we see that
the orange line is the height of the triangle, which also equals to the height of the rectangle. Also, the base of the 
triangle is equal to the width of the rectangle. Therefore, the area of a triangle is equal to $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$.

This is what the mathematician's art is about: asking simple and pure questions about imaginary things and crafting
beautiful explanations. The dotted orange line in the illustration above was the key to solving the problem, but how did 
we came up with the idea to draw that line? Inspiration, experience, creativity, and trial and error. In my next 
post (it's a trilogy at this point), I will discuss how one can improve their mathematical skills and understand the art.
But for now, students are treated to just memorising the "facts" that were set by authorities. And, do you know what 
is the worst part? These facts are taught with *songs*. Look at [this short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/uvHbA8YwsyY)
by Al. Only the "quadratic formula song" is left in students' minds—in the video, it is said that nobody remembers 
how to use it—and, this is what this amazing and fascinating art is reduced to: a song. Kind of ironic isn't it?
